# ConcordanceExercise

  This project is designed to take an arbitrary text document and create a concordance of all the words. The words are also mapped to the sentence numbers in which they appear. To accomplish this the program reads a text file then cleans the file of various special charecters and new line charecters to easily identify words and sentences. Then the file is split into two lists that contain 1) sentences and 2) words. A dictionary is iniatized to store words becuase it will automatically delete repeats. One loop will check if a word in the dictionary to create a count of occurances of the word. The next loop will check that dictionary against the sentences to create a list of sentence numbers. The final output will have the word -> occurances -> sentences in which the word appears.
